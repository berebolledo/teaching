> Chat GPT prompt: *Which are the most common file formats in bioinformatics?*

> Bioinformatics involves the analysis and interpretation of large biological datasets, and a variety of file formats are used to store and exchange such data. Here are some of the most common file formats used in bioinformatics:

 - [**FASTA**](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-topics/): This is a text-based format used to represent nucleotide or protein sequences.

 - [**FASTQ**](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_OLH_009008/Content/Source/Informatics/BS/FileFormat_FASTQ-files_swBS.htm): This is a text-based format used to store both the nucleotide sequence and the corresponding quality scores for each base in a sequencing read.

 - [**BAM/SAM**](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf): These are binary/text-based formats used to store alignment data from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments.

 - [**VCF**](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531692-VCF-Variant-Call-Format): This is a text-based format used to store genetic variation data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels).

 - [**BED**](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1): This is a text-based format used to represent genomic regions, such as the locations of genes, regulatory elements, or genetic variants.

 - [**GTF/GFF**](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format3): These are text-based formats used to store gene annotation data, including information about gene structure, exons, introns, and other features.

 - [**PDB**](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/primary-sequences-and-the-pdb-format): This is a binary format used to store 3D protein structure data.

 - [**CSV/TSV**](https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils/blob/master/docs/comparing-tsv-and-csv.md): These are text-based formats used to store tabular data, such as gene expression measurements or protein-protein interaction data.

 - [**HDF5**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q14F3WRwSck): This is a binary format used to store large and complex datasets, such as high-throughput sequencing data or microarray data.

 - [**XML/JSON**](https://www.javatpoint.com/json-vs-xml): These are text-based formats used for data exchange and storage, and are often used in web-based applications or database management systems in bioinformatics.

> Note that there are many other file formats used in bioinformatics, and the choice of format often depends on the type of data being analyzed and the software tools being used.
